Problem Statement: Write a program to calculate the simple interest for given principal, rate, and time. The formula for calculating simple interest is: Simple Interest = (P X R X T)/100

Requirements:

Calculate the simple interest using the provided formula.

Print the result in the format: "The simple interest is: Z" where Z is the calculated interest.

Test Cases:

Test Case 1: Principal = 1000, Rate = 5, Time = 3. Expected output: "The simple interest is: 150.0"

Test Case 2: Principal = 1500, Rate = 7, Time = 5. Expected output: "The simple interest is: 525.0"

Test Case 3: Principal = 0, Rate = 6, Time = 2. Expected output: "The simple interest is: 0.0"

Edge Cases:

Edge Case 1: What if any parameter is zero? The calculation should proceed as normal, yielding zero interest if the principal is zero.

Edge Case 2: What if negative values are entered for any parameter? The program should handle this by printing: "Invalid input, all values must be non-negative."
