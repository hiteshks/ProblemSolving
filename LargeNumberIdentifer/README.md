Problem Statement: Write a program that compares two input numbers and determines which one is larger or if they are equal.

Requirements: Compare the numbers using conditional statements. Print which number is larger or if they are the same in a clear, formatted string.

Test Cases:

Test Case 1: number1 = 5, number2 = 10. Expected output: "10 is larger than 5"

Test Case 2: number1 = 7, number2 = 7. Expected output: "Both numbers are equal"

Test Case 3: number1 = -1, number2 = -10. Expected output: "-1 is larger than -10"

Edge Cases:

Edge Case 1: What if both numbers are zero? Expected output: "Both numbers are equal"

Edge Case 2: What if the numbers are negative? The logic should still correctly identify which is larger or if they are equal.
