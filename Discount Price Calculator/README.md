Problem Statement: A store offers a 10% discount on items priced more than $20. Develop a program to calculate and display the final price after the discount if applicable.

Requirements: Apply a 10% discount if the price is greater than $20. Print the final price formatted as: "The final price of the item is: Y" where Y is the price after any applicable discounts.

Test Cases:

Test Case 1: original price = $25. Expected output: "The final price of the item is: 22.5"

Test Case 2: original price = $20. Expected output: "The final price of the item is: 20"

Test Case 3: original price = $15. Expected output: "The final price of the item is: 15"

Edge Cases:

Edge Case 1: What if the price is exactly $20? The output should show no discount applied.

Edge Case 2: What if the price is a negative number? The program should handle this by printing: "Invalid price, the price must be a non-negative number."
